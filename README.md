## ðŸ“Š Data Analyst / Business Analytics

I'm a passionate Data Analyst with over 2 years of experience turning raw data into meaningful insights. I specialize in data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to help businesses make better, data-informed decisions.

My technical skills include:

- **SQL** â€“ for querying and managing relational databases
- **Python** â€“ using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and analysis
- **Excel** â€“ for quick analyses, dashboards, and automation
- **Power BI & Tableau** â€“ for creating interactive, visually engaging dashboards and reports

Over the past two years, Iâ€™ve worked on various real-world projects involving customer behavior analysis, sales trend reporting, campaign performance tracking, and operations optimization. Iâ€™m particularly interested in using data to solve business problems and improve efficiency.

What I enjoy most about data analytics is the ability to find patterns, tell stories with numbers, and contribute to decision-making that has a real impact.

I'm continuously learning and currently exploring more about advanced analytics, machine learning, and cloud-based data tools.
